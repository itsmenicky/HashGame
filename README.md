</br><p align=justify>HashGame developed in Python. The game is simple, with a printout of the board map to make the moves easier, as well as organizing the moves by column and position. I would like to thank Gabriel Meira (https://github.com/gabrielmeiradev) for his contribution to this project, who performed the main functions related to validating the moves.</p>
